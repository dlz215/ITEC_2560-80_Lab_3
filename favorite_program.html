    <h1>SQL Script: Gym Relationship Data</h1>
</div>

<div id="description">
    <p>This is a SQL script I wrote at work using techniques I learned in Andy's SQL Server class which I took last
        semester.To keep things simple - I do software support for a gym franchising company. We have a database table
        that's used to set up business relationships between gyms in our network. Each unique relationship between two
        gyms requires inserting 2 or 4 rows into the table. Whether it's 2 or 4 depends on certain factors including
        whether the gyms are in the same state or not. We were previously using a script written by a former member of
        our team, but we found that the script was inserting a lot of redundant rows each time we ran it. I borrowed
        some pieces of their script but mostly wrote a new version that checks before inserting so no duplicate rows
        are inserted.</p>

    <p>Note: because the script contains names of servers, databases, and tables I prefer not to put it in a
        public repository for security reasons.</p>
</div>

<div>
    <p class="code-description">Enter IDs of 2 or more gyms. Relationships will be set up between each unique pair of
        gyms (if one doesn't already exist). We have some large groups numbering over 100 that frequently need to have
        one or two new gyms added.</p>
